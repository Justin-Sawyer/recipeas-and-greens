<h1 align="center"><a href="">Recipeas and Greens</a></h1>

<img src="documentation/image-aid/screenshot.png">

This is the website and application for Recipeas and Greens, a database of recipes created by a community of members.

The website is by design simple, and is designed for ease of use. 
It is primarily targeted towards an audience that has little experience of storing recipes in a web application, 
preferring up until now to store their "home-made" recipes on paper, or within physical folders.

While the website is free to use and join, and recipes are by design exposed (and thus accesible) to the public, 
the creator of the website intends to use the site to sell a range of kitchen accessories.

## User Experience (UX)

- ### User stories:
    - #### First Time Visitors:
		1) As a first time visitor, I want to see a range of recipes that detail both ingredients and preparation. 
        As a plus, I would like to see the level of difficulty for each particular recipe, its preparation and cooking times, 
        and the category for each recipe.

		2) I want the design of each recipe to be accorded to my particular screen size: 
			- With a large screen such as a desktop or a tablet in a landscape orientation, I would like both ingredients and preparation to be visible together, 
            side by side, so that I can ensure that I have not missed anything.
			- With smaller screens, such as tablets in portrait orientation and mobile devices, 
            I want to be able to flip easily between the recipe's ingredients and preparation.

		3) I want a banner image showing what I should be aiming for with each recipe. 
        The banner image is meant to display the final meal, and also to draw me in and encourage me to both return to the website and join the community.

		4) Upon loading the website, I would like to be presented with the most recently added recipes. 
        I want these recipes to be shown with images, in order to whet my appetite. 

		5) I want the possibility to both search for recipes and simply view recipes based on their category or level of difficulty via a simple click of buttons. 
        Thus, on the loading page (but not within the navigation) I want to see buttons listing (for example) "Quick and Easy", "Challenging" or "Difficult". 
        On pressing these links, I want to be presented with the most recently uploaded recipes within these criteria. 
        Conversely, if I press the button "Category", I want to be taken to a generic page that lists (with images overlaid by the category name) each category. 
        Upon clicking these images, I then want to be taken to a page showing the most recently uploaded recipes within that category.

		6) I want to be encouraged to join the community and thus enter my own recipes for the community to use and enjoy. 
        Although there might not be monetary incentives for joining the community, I would like it to to be made clear that there are indeed advantages to joining, 
        such as the possibility to upvote, comment and mark recipes as personal favourites. 
        I want this functionality so that I do not have to keep scrolling through a potentially endless list of recipes before finding the recipe I enjoyed preparing (and eating!) 
        last week, last month or last year.

		7) If I decide to join the community, I would like to be able to create my Account. I want the account to be simple, and simple to modify. 
        My Account should not overwhelm me, but should rather contain simple entries for my (first and last) name, a username that I choose, my email address and a description of me. 
        While the description is not obligatory, I understand that having a functioning Account means that including my name, 
        username and email are required for building my personal database of recipes.

		8) If I decide to join the community, I want my list of favourite recipes to be built automatically, by a simple press on an icon such as a "+" or a "heart". 
        I then want these favourited or loved recipes to appear both within my account details, but more importantly, directly from the navigation of the website. 
        In other words, I do not want to have to access my Account page before being able to access my favourite recipes.

		9) I want the website to remember me. Once logged in, I want to stay logged in, unless I choose to log out.

		10) If I decide to join the community, I want to be able to add my own recipes. The process must be simple, and I should be prompted how to add ingredients, 
        the preparation method, the category of the recipe, its difficulty level and its preparation and cooking times.

	- #### Returning Visitors:

		1) I want the conditions listed for First Time Visitors to be true also for myself as a Returning Visitor.

		2) If I have not yet joined the community, I would like to be prompted to join upon returning to the website.

		3) As a returning member, I want the navigation of the website to reflect my membership status. Thus, I want to see within the navigation links a link to my favourite recipes.

		4) As a returning member, I want to be able to add new recipes, edit previous recipes, edit my Account details if any of these have changed. 

		5) I want to be able to search for recipes based on their names, their ingredients, their categories and their ease of preparation. 
        For example, if I return home late from work during a weeknight, I want to be able to search for "Quick and Easy" recipes. 
        Ultimately, I would like to then refine my search to include what I have in my pantry or fridge. 
        Thus while using the search functionality, if I search for "Quick and Easy spaghetti", 
        I would like to be presented with recipes that are both "Quick and Easy" *and* have "spaghetti" as a listed ingredient. 
        These recipes need not be only in my personal favourites, but the search must list all community recipes with these criteria.

		6) Conversely, as a returing member, if I decide that this is a community I no longer want to be a part of, I want the possibility to Delete My Account. 
        The deleting process must be simple, but I do not want to be able to delete my Account by accident. 
        Thus, I want to be prompted with an alert, for example, that asks me simply to verify that I wish to Delete My Account. 
        I also want it to be made clear to me that clicking "Delete Account" deletes all of my uploaded recipes, and clears any community recipes from my own personal list of favourites. 
        Thus, if at a later date I decide to rejoin the community, 
        I want it made clear to me on deleting my Account that I will have to rebuild my recipes and list of favourites as any new community member would.

	- #### Frequent Visitors:
		1) I want the conditions listed for First Time Visitors and Returning Visitors to be true also for myself as a Frequent Visitor.

		2) I want the process of adding new recipes to be "second nature". In other words, unless absolutely necessary, if there is an update to the website, 
        I want the process of uploading new recipes to remain "as is". 
        If there is a necessity to change the process of adding or editing recipes, I want this change to be virtually invisible (unnoticeable) to me as an end user. 
        Thus, I can become what is known as a "power user" with ease. 

		3) As a frequent visitor, I want to be reminded subtly that this website exists to sell its range of cooking utensils. 
        Thus, if while otherwise occupied, I realise I need a new saucepan (for example), I want to be brought back to this website, as I have seen such items listed within the website. 
        In other words, I want to remember that I can simply go to "recipeas-and-greens.com" and order the new saucepan, 
        and avoid spending hours looking for one that suits on a sales website such as Amazon.

- ### Design:
    - #### Colour scheme:
		The project uses a simple design, with colours that are designed to make the end user think of food. 
        The website is named "Reci***PEAS*** and ***GREENS***" and therefore green is the natural choice for its primary colour. 
        Green is the colour of both most vegetables and most herbs. 
        
        The green is contrasted with brown, which makes the end user think of the warmth of spice and spice mixtures.

	- #### Typography:
		As the website is aimed towards the generation that uses paper or physical folders to store their personal recipes, the typography must be simple. 
        For this reason, different weights of a single font are preferred over different fonts to discern between titles and text. 
        However, where called for, subtle uses of different fonts (a font designed to make the user think of desserts, 
        or of pasta or of a region such as Asia) may be used on the images for those particular categories.

	- #### Imagery:
		Imagery is extremely important on this website. Nothing makes the tongue water more than seeing a beautifully presented meal. 
        The images inspire the user to both try the recipe, and more importantly, join the community and become an active member.

		Ideally, each recipe page should have the final end meal for that recipe as its banner image. 
        Where this is not possible, the banner image should be an image of the recipe's category (i.e. "Italian" rather than "Quick and Easy").

		Thus, when uploading a recipe to the website, the community member should be prompted to add an image of the prepared meal. 
        Ideally, upon uploading the photo of the prepared meal, the user should be shown how the image will appear as a banner, and then be prompted to accept the image or upload another.

## Code Testing
This project has been a labour of love and has taken many, many hours to complete. Code was tested exhaustively to check for errors and bugs:

### Registration:

The registration template page had a few ugly parts to it. Having told the HTML input code to accept only certain patterns (length of username and password, conditions for email and password), the developer found it prudent to tell the user that the entries would only be accepted if they met these conditions. That is, the username having a minumum of 6 characters, the password having a minimum of 8 characters, which must include a minimum of at least 1 number, 1 uppercase letter and 1 lowercase letter. However, the input text fields did not allow for all of this information.

The developer toyed with the idea of creating a separate `<div>` element to tell the user of these conditions, but felt that the information was best being placed within each label.

First, the developer added separate `<p>` elements after each label, but found the text was not indented:

```
<!-- Choose User Name -->
<div class="row registration" id="username-row">
	<div class="input-field col s12">
		<i class="fas fa-user-plus prefix green-text text-darken-2"></i>
		<input id="username" name="username" type="text" minlength="6" maxlength="24" pattern="^[a-zA-Z0-9]{6,24}$"class="validate" required>
		<label for="username">Choose a Username</label>
		<p>Minimum 6 characters</p>
	</div>
</div>

```
<img src="code-result-screenshots/registration-form-conditions-1.png"

Next, the developer tried adding line breaks within the label:

```
<label for="username">Choose a Username <br><br>Min 6 characters</label>
```

This worked well:

<img src="code-result-screenshots/registration-form-conditions-2.png"

However, when it came to inputting text into the field, the result was not so good:

<img src="code-result-screenshots/registration-form-conditions-3.png"

Additionally, the developer faced problems with rendering the labels on different screen sizes. Below is a screenshot of the password field on a 425px width screen (or, large Mobile screen):

<img src="code-result-screenshots/registration-form-conditions-4.png"

The developer solved these issues through a use of CSS, effectively changing the label font size according to the width of the screen:

```
@media only screen and (max-width: 750px) {
    .input-field>label {
        font-size: 0.8rem;
    }
}

@media only screen and (max-width: 400px) {
    .input-field>label {
        font-size: 0.7rem;
    }
}
```

Here is the result on a 375px wide screen:

<img src="code-result-screenshots/registration-form-conditions-5.png"

The developer then tried to create an Account, however the Autocomplete function for the form then inserted blocks of colour as well as the autocompleted items (in Google Chrome):

<img src="code-result-screenshots/registration-form-conditions-6.png"

As can be seen in the screenshot above, this result was very ugly. To counter this, the developer inserted another block of CSS and added class="registration" to each `row` within the `card-panel`:

```
.registration {
    background-color: white;
}
```

The end result is much more eye-catching, but still renders oddly on different browsers. Google Chrome renders the background in blue, while Safari renders it in yellow:

Chrome:

<img src="code-result-screenshots/registration-form-conditions-7.png"

Safari:

<img src="code-result-screenshots/registration-form-conditions-8.png"

The devloper then looked for a better solution on StackOverflow, and found the following snippet:

```
/* Change the autofill background color 
From https://stackoverflow.com/a/14205976/14773450 */
input:-webkit-autofill,
input:-webkit-autofill:hover, 
input:-webkit-autofill:focus, 
input:-webkit-autofill:active {
    -webkit-box-shadow: 0 0 0 30px white inset !important;
    box-shadow: 0 0 0 30px white inset !important;
}
```

The code was pushed to Git, and the results were almost as expected: the background stays white on both browsers on desktop devices. However, on iOS, the background color persists. The developer found a further snippet of code on StackOverflow:

```
/* From https://stackoverflow.com/a/58682412/14773450 */
background-clip: content-box !important;
```

The background now stays white on Safari for iOS when autocomplete is used.
